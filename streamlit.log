warning: Resolving despite existing lockfile due to fork markers being disjoint with `requires-python`: `python_full_version >= '3.13'` vs `python_full_version >= '3.9' and python_full_version < '3.12'`
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies for split (markers:
  │ python_full_version == '3.9.*'):
  ╰─▶ Because the requested Python version (>=3.9, <3.12) does not
      satisfy Python>=3.10.0,<4.0.0 and langchain>=1.1.0 depends on
      Python>=3.10.0,<4.0.0, we can conclude that langchain>=1.1.0 cannot
      be used.
      And because only the following versions of langchain are available:
          langchain<=1.1.0
          langchain==1.1.1
          langchain==1.1.2
          langchain==1.1.3
          langchain==1.2.0
      and your project depends on langchain>=1.1.0, we can conclude that your
      project's requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: The `requires-python` value (>=3.9, <3.12) includes Python
      versions that are not supported by your dependencies (e.g.,
      langchain>=1.1.0 only supports >=3.10.0, <4.0.0). Consider using a more
      restrictive `requires-python` value (like >=3.10.0, <4.0.0).

      hint: While the active Python version is 3.11, the resolution failed for
      other Python versions supported by your project. Consider limiting your
      project's supported Python versions using `requires-python`.
